Questions
=========
Conceptually what are "on" the layers - tagged text chunks, or the tags themselves ? I have opted for tagged text, but the TAGML docs are not clear.
Why does TAGML mandate a '+' to introduce a new layer when auto-creation is simpler and less context-sensitive ?
Does all text not on a named layer exist on a single un-named layer ? 
Should layers have namespaces (e.g to distinguish between semantic layers and ones used to resolve self-overlapping ambiguity) ?
is un-tagged text (or text outside a "root" tag) valid? If not, why not ?
What is the use of alternates without metadata to distinguish between them ?
Should it be possible to indicate that text is on a layer without enclosing it in a tag pair ?
Why are annotation values not strict JSON ?
What is the benefit of layer inference in close tags ? It's both dangerous and (relatively) complex to process. Does anyone really want to save a couple of keystrokes this way ?
The whitespace normalisation rules seem strange if the aim is to preserve and annotate the original text. What if you are tracking (for example) trends in one-space vs two-spaces after a peroid ?
